"""Claude Code Stop hook: block ending the turn when code files were edited
but no test/verification command ran and no verification-intent subagent was
dispatched. Mechanically enforces operational-rigor §4 (verify by execution)
and §5 (independent verification for load-bearing work).

Adapted from `verify_gate.py` in curtischoutw/claude-institution @ 8dea062
(MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Curtis Chou), itself adapted from
Miguok/fable-harness. Detection logic preserved; messages rewritten to point
at this pack's rules. Python 3.8+, stdlib only.

Behavior:
- Only triggers when code-extension files were edited this turn AND no test
  command / verification-intent agent appeared. Doc/config edits never block.
- A dispatched subagent whose prompt shows verification intent counts as
  verification — the hook must not punish the pack's own delegate-the-check rule.
- Test commands match at command position (start of line or after ;|&|(),
  so `cat pytest.ini` does not count as running tests.
- stop_hook_active (the second Stop) always passes — relief valve so a
  blocked turn cannot deadlock; the pass is logged for audit.
- Fail-open: any internal error passes, with the traceback logged.
- Quiet-degradation telemetry (2026-07-24, after Miguok/fable-harness
  b6f794e fixed the same defect class upstream): every silent no-op path
  now attempts to leave a log line (best-effort — _log swallows its own
  failures to preserve fail-open), so a harness schema drift cannot
  disable the gate invisibly for weeks. Levels (checked after the relief
  valve — a second Stop logs its own PASS first): missing transcript_path
  = ERROR (schema drift); a transcript with user entries but no real prompt = PASS with
  reason (known degenerate shape — sampled 2026-07-24: real sessions carry
  61-209 user entries, mostly list-content tool results); a transcript
  with NO user-type entries at all (or empty) = WARN (unknown shape,
  possible drift).

Known limits (mechanically unfixable; do not treat this hook as omniscient):
- It checks that a test command / verify agent APPEARED, not that tests
  passed or the verification was honest.
- Double-Stop escape: after a block, replying anything and stopping again
  passes (the relief valve). The audit log is the only compensation.
- The window covers only tool calls after the last real user prompt.
- Env-var-prefixed commands (FOO=1 pytest) are not matched; neither are
  option-prefixed interpreter forms (bash -e test-x.sh, python3 -u
  checks.py) — the wrapper allowlist (time/npx/uv run/...) is literal.
