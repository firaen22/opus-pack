description: Implementation-agnostic motion judgment for product UI. Load when you are adding, reviewing, or tuning animation in any framework - durations, easings, springs, staggers, entrances/exits, gesture handoff, reduced motion - when a spec says "smooth" or "delightful" with no numbers attached, or when you notice animation being judged by feel instead of against a budget. NOT for debugging one animation library's API (use its docs), for static visual decisions (ui-design-craft), or for running a design review end-to-end (design-review-gate).

# Motion Craft

Every animation must serve **feedback** ("it worked"), **continuity** ("that's
where it went"), or **hierarchy** ("look here"). An animation serving none of
the three is removed, not tuned. When in doubt: shorter, subtler, or none.

## 1. Duration budgets

Numbers first; taste second. Defaults for product UI:

| Surface | Budget |
|---|---|
| Hover / press feedback | 90-160ms |
| Tooltip, micro popover | 80-200ms |
| Dropdown, select, small panel | 150-250ms |
| Accordion, tab switch | 160-240ms |
| Card / list item enter-exit | 180-350ms |
| Modal, drawer, sheet | 200-400ms |
| Route / page transition | 240-500ms |

- **Standard interactions stay under 300ms; nothing in product UI exceeds
  500ms.** A 180ms dropdown reads as more responsive than a 400ms one.
- **Exit = 65-75% of entrance.** Leaving is confirmation, not an event.
- **Distance scales duration:** 100px is the base; 200px ~1.3x, 400px ~1.6x,
  full-screen ~1.8-2.0x. Small moves at long durations read as lag.
- **Frequency scales duration DOWN.** An action done 100 times a day
  approaches instant. Hard sub-rule: **never animate keyboard-initiated
  actions** - they repeat hundreds of times daily and animation makes them
  feel disconnected from the keystroke.
  ❌ "the command palette fades in over 250ms - it looks polished in the demo."
  ✅ keyboard-opened palette appears instantly; its pointer-opened twin may
  animate.
- Trigger for this section: any duration you are about to write, or any
  existing duration outside the table. Done when every duration in the diff
  sits inside its row's budget or carries a written justification.

## 2. Easing

| Direction | Curve | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Enter | ease-out | fast start = instant feedback, soft landing |
| Exit | ease-in | soft start, fast leave |
| On-screen move / morph | ease-in-out | smooth both ends |
| Spinners, progress, marquee | linear | mechanical processes read linear |

- **Never linear for spatial movement; never ease-in for entrances.** An
  ease-in dropdown at 300ms feels slower than ease-out at the same 300ms:
  it delays movement in the exact frames the user watches most closely.
- Named defaults (checked against the vendors' current tokens - see
  Provenance): Material 3 standard `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`; M3
  emphasized-decelerate `cubic-bezier(0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1)`; Apple HIG default
  `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)`. Note the common mislabel: `(0.4, 0,
  0.2, 1)` is Material *2*'s standard, routinely pasted as "M3".

## 3. Springs and gesture physics

- Spring parameters below are **coefficients in the Framer Motion / React
  Spring convention** (stiffness + damping). A damping *ratio* (where <1.0
  oscillates and 1.0 is critical) is a different unit - mixing the two
  conventions is a recurring published error; name which one you are using.

| Feel | Stiffness | Damping |
|---|---|---|
| Snappy UI | ~400 | 25-30 |
| Standard | 250-350 | 18-24 |
| Bouncy (sparingly) | 150-250 | 10-15 |

- **Springs must settle.** Default to critically damped (no overshoot);
  reserve bounce for momentum-driven physical interactions - a little
  overshoot is earned by a flick, never by a click. Prolonged wobble
  ("jello") is a defect, not personality.
- **Momentum projection** (where a flick should land): Apple ships the
  exponential-decay form `projectedDistance = (velocity / 1000) * d / (1 - d)`
  with `d ~= 0.998` - NOT the physics-textbook `v^2 / (2 * deceleration)`.
- **Rubber-band overscroll:** `(overshoot * dimension * c) / (dimension + c *
  |overshoot|)` with `c = 0.55` - resistance grows the further past the bound.
- **Velocity handoff:** when a gesture ends, the animation continues at the
  finger's velocity: `relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (target -
  current)` (libraries taking raw px/s can be handed the gesture velocity
  directly). A visible seam between drag and animation is the tell this rule
  was skipped.
- **Momentum dismissal is velocity-based, not distance-based:** compute
  `|distance| / elapsedMs` and dismiss above ~0.11 - a flick should be
  enough; requiring a distance threshold makes flicks feel ignored.

## 4. Choreography

- **Stagger:** 30-80ms between items; total sequence under 500ms; stagger is
  decorative - it must never block interaction while playing.
- **One thing leads.** Everything animating at once with equal weight is
  noise; pick the hero element, let the rest follow or fade.
- **Overshoot budget by context:** success 5-10%; generic feedback 2-5%;
  celebration up to 25%; **errors and destructive confirmations 0%** - play
  nothing bouncy on the worst moment of the user's session.
- **Asymmetric deliberate/response timing:** where the user is deciding
  (press-and-hold, destructive confirm) the animation may run slow; the
  system's response snaps. Symmetric timing on a press-and-release
  interaction is a finding, not a style choice.

## 5. Performance traps

- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only; anything animating layout
  properties (width, height, top, padding) is rewritten, not accepted.
- **`transition: all` is banned.**
  ❌ `transition: all 300ms ease` - animates properties you never intended
  and recalculates layout every frame.
  ✅ `transition: transform 200ms ease-out, opacity 200ms ease-out`.
- Framer Motion's shorthand props (`x`, `y`, `scale`) are **not**
  hardware-accelerated - they tween on the main thread via rAF. Under load,
  use the full `transform` string.
- Updating a CSS variable on a parent recalculates styles for **all
  children** - in a drawer with many items, drive `transform` on the moving
  element directly instead of `--offset` on the container.
- Animations are interruptible: new input retargets mid-flight (CSS
  transitions and springs retarget; keyframes restart from zero - wrong for
  toasts, toggles, anything triggered rapidly); no fill-mode or delay may
  block interaction.
- **Never enter from `scale(0)`** - nothing real appears from nothing; enter
  from `scale(0.9-0.97)` plus opacity.
- Set `transform-origin` for scale/rotate: popovers, dropdowns, and tooltips
  scale from their trigger, not center (modals are the exemption - they stay
  centered); SVG needs `transform-box: fill-box` on a wrapping `<g>`.
- Gate hover motion behind `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` -
  touch devices fire false hovers on tap.

## 6. Reduced motion is a floor, not a feature

- Every animation ships a `prefers-reduced-motion` variant. Reduced means
  **fewer and gentler, not zero**: keep opacity/color transitions that aid
  comprehension; drop movement - slide+fade -> fade; scale+fade -> fade;
  spring -> short tween; parallax and auto-playing loops -> removed.
  Transform-based full-screen motion is the highest-cost vestibular
  trigger - it is exactly what this media query exists for.
- Motion is never the only signal of a state change: pair it with a static
  affordance (color, position, label) or reduced-motion users miss the
  change entirely.

## 7. Misquoted research - do not cite these wrong

Adopted from open-design's primary-literature review (see Provenance);
statements below follow the cited papers, not the folklore:

- "Skeleton screens feel 11% faster" - Harrison/Yeo/Hudson CHI 2010 measured
  backwards-decelerating ribbed *progress bars* (n=16), not skeletons; the
  mechanism does not transfer.
- "Doherty threshold = 400ms" - Doherty & Thadani (IBM Systems Journal 1982)
  contains no 400ms figure; the lowest threshold actually measured is 300ms.
- "Heer & Robertson recommend 300-1000ms transitions" - they tested 1.25s
  and 2s only, and recommend roughly one second per animated stage.
- Motion *confirms* state changes; it must not *perform* them. Optimistic UI
  first, animation second.

## 8. Pre-ship gate

Run against the built surface, not the source: trigger each interaction and
watch it. Severity-tiered; every CRITICAL verified by observation before
"done".

- **CRITICAL:** reduced-motion variant exists and was toggled on and
  observed; nothing exceeds 500ms; no spring fails to settle; no
  keyboard-initiated action animates; no `transition: all`.
- **HIGH:** durations inside §1 budgets; easing direction per §2; exits
  faster than entrances; layout-property animation absent.
- **MEDIUM:** stagger within budget; `transform-origin` set for scale;
  consistent timings across sibling components; overshoot within §4 context
  budget.

Done when: every CRITICAL item observed passing, HIGH items pass or carry a
written exception, and any failure names the rule it broke (not "feels off").

## When NOT to use this skill

- Debugging one library's API surface -> that library's docs; this file owns
  budgets and judgment, not APIs.
- Static layout/type/color decisions -> `ui-design-craft`.
- Running a full design review with measurement and fix loop ->
  `design-review-gate` (its motion pass applies this file's budgets).
- Marketing hero choreography on a page whose brief explicitly buys
  spectacle: §1 caps may be exceeded there, deliberately and in writing -
  the purpose test and reduced-motion floor still apply.

## Provenance

Composed 2026-07-19 for design-pack 0.1.0. Sources, all verified in their
repos at composition time: Emil Kowalski's `emilkowalski/skills` (MIT) -
duration budgets, keyboard rule, stagger numbers, Framer shorthand and CSS
variable performance traps, Apple-derived projection / rubber-band / velocity
handoff forms (his distillation of Apple WWDC material; formulas quoted from
his files); LottieFiles `motion-design-skill` (MIT) - element duration table,
distance-duration multipliers, exit ratio, stagger and overshoot budgets,
severity-tier gate shape (their damping-units conflation is corrected here,
not copied); `referodesign/refero_skill` (MIT) - purpose triad, easing
direction table, reduced-motion mapping, `transition: all` ban. §7's
corrections and the M2/M3 mislabel are adopted from nexu-io/open-design's
`craft/animation-discipline.md` primary-source review (Apache-2.0; facts and
citations restated in this pack's words, no text copied); the primary papers
were not independently re-opened for this pack. greensock/gsap-skills was
surveyed and deliberately not mined: library-usage doctrine, out of scope
here. Numeric values (beziers, spring pairs, budgets) are the volatile
facts - re-verify against Material 3 motion tokens and Apple HIG on major
vendor releases. Probe status: probe-tested 2026-07-19 on a
private over-budget motion-spec fixture (fresh weak-tier agent, n=1 per
arm, smoke grade): the bare arm caught ~3 of 7 planted violations, loosely
phrased - though it did catch the missing reduced-motion variant, recorded
honestly - while the ruled arm caught 7 of 7 with budget citations,
including the keyboard rule and the 500ms total-stagger cap the bare arm
lacked as concepts. A round-0 run was voided for a leaked in-fixture
answer key. Trail in the design-pack PR.
